    <!-- Images
    alt -> helps google to index what the website means when someone is lookig up the specific word.
          So currently my image is hosted on Twitter's servers and my browser has to download it from there in
      order to display it inside my web page.
      Now what if Twitter goes down what if they die what if nobody wants to send tweets anymore.
      Well then their service is going to be shut down.
      And my image will no longer be available for download and you will instead end up or something that
      looks a little bit like this and you might have come across it in the past when you've been loading
      up Web sites.
      It means that the image is no longer available or is no longer hosted at the address that specified
      in the source.
      So in order to remove our reliance on Twitter we can also put an image into our fold.
      HTL personal site and refer to it inside source.
      So let's go ahead and do that.
      Now if I go onto my desktop inside wept Veltman inside the folder HVM Bell personal site.
      I can drag and drop or paste an image of me into this folder and now my index page HTML and my picture
      could Angela up DNG is in the same folder and I can refer to it inside my code.
      So instead of using a web address as the source of my image I can simply refer to the file name because
      they are at the same level so index and changed him an an up PMG at the same high rock level that both
      inside my site.
      Now if I had an images folder and I put my image into the then I would have to add a path to get there.
      So it would be something like this.
